Add your own handlers to [\]gf mapping.
This way you can jump to tags, git hashs, class names etc.

gf/gF also have the issue that you can't open files which don't exist yet.
This plugin doesn't care whether a file exists or not (its biased if one exists though)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
customization ~
You can use another lhs of a mapping this way: >
  let g['config']['goto-thing-handler-mapping-lhs'] = 'gf'
>

Adding your own handlers. Example vim files only:
in ftplugin/filetype.vim: >
  call on_thing_handler#AddOnThingHandler('b', funcref#Function('haxe#gfHandler'))
<

You can replace 'b' by 'g' to add a handler to all buffers.

A function such as haxe#gfHandler should return a list of either
- a simple string (filename)
- a dict:
  a dict: { 'break': 1, 'filename' : file [, 'line_nr' line nr ] [, 'info' : 'shown before filename'] }
  if break is set to 1 then this match will win. If multiple results have break set the user will be prompted.
  The idea is that you can return multiple paths and if one exiists it is
  opened, if it does not you'll be prompted about which one to open

plugins using this plugin:
- vim-addon-nix: going to include files
- vim-dev: jump to function definitions without tag files
- vim-addon-git: my simple git plugin (you can jump to filepaths dropping a/ b/ in diffs and to hashes)
...

A very similar idea has been implemented in vim-addon-toggle-buffer. However
its purpose is to toggle files by context. Examples are
- C/C++ .h and .c files
- Vim: find .vim files in the same plugin directory (eg toggle autoload and plugin .vim files)

  note: author would be fine with merging both projects.
  I don't have time to do so. vim-addon-goto-thing-at-cursor does not support
  system comamnds (opening images) yet.
  Don't have time right now :(
